    Crafting Sonic Worlds Where Technology and Storytelling Converge

    At the intersection of art, code, and narrative lies my passion - weaving together sound, visuals, and interactivity to transport audiences into immersive virtual realms. With a multidisciplinary background spanning music production, software development, and experience design, I blend creative and technical disciplines to forge experiences that captivate the senses and imagination.

    Sound is my potent storytelling instrument, shaped through music, spatial audio techniques, and interactive design. I wield it to heighten emotional resonance, ground presence, and forge visceral connections between the player and their world.

    As a creative technologist, I guide teams through every phase of an interactive project's life cycle - from initial concepting and prototyping to production and deployment. My work manifests across diverse platforms like VR, AR, games, apps, and the web.

    I've crafted evocative sonic landscapes for interactive VR narratives like Kindred and The Third Pill. Whether composing ethereal soundscapes, coding audio-reactive systems, or prototyping innovative UX, my goal remains transporting viewers to realms where technology and embodied storytelling become indistinguishable. 

    Through this fusion of sound, visuals, code, and pure imagination, I strive to create experiences that inspire awe, wonder, and impossible dreams.
