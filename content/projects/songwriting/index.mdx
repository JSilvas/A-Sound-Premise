In my late teens and early 20s, I began working with an artist manager in Los Angelos. I plugged into a network of capable producers, musicians, and the publishing company Heavy Hitters Music with a focus on creating music for TV and film. Within a few years, I'd collected together a catalog of original compositions, co-productions, and studio recordings under my name. That amounted to thousands of hours recording in studios, songwriting, performing, and learning professional music and audio production from an incredibly talented community of artists and engineers.
